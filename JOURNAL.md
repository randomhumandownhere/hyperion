backstory: i've been putting off Highway for quite a while, but my friends @Candy and @Danerack got me to actually start so here goes nothing!

i'm currently finishing up the ideas and sketches for hyperion, helios and prometheus (my Highway projects). made the repo and wrote the README.md today.

a human arm has 7DOF: 
- 3 are at the shoulder (pitch, yaw and roll)
- 1 is at the elbow (pitch)
- 1 is at the forearm (roll)
- 2 are at the wrist (pitch and roll)

i'm not too sure wheter i should use flex sensors or rotary encoders with linkages attached to rings on each finger for the hand. one one hand, flex sensors are easier to use but they are expensive and have a range of error. on the other, rotary encoders with linkages are slightly harder to model. either way, i'd need a glove to have it be comfortable.

if i add any strength augmentation features i'd probably have to use some belts and minor hydraulics
(not planned though)

another priority of mine is that hyperion isnt bulky and its lightweight enough to be carried around (foldable perhaps?) and has to have a long lasting battery pack due to having to be both wireless and run a local MV model while having a low-latency.

time spent this session: ~3 hours
