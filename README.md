# hyperion ■ 

## what?
hyperion is an open source arm exoskeleton with 7DOF. it is powered by a Raspberry Pi 0 2W and has MV features powered by an AI camera. its primary use is controlling robotic devices such as [prometheus ◣](https://github.com/randomhumandownhere/prometheus) and [helios ◥](https://github.com/randomhumandownhere/helios). 

## why?
i built hyperion as i wanted an open and easy to use exoskeleton for controlling robots (however, i might add more later). using it lets you control robotic devices and software in a simple way without breaking the bank. hyperion is **completely** modular so you can make extensions or modify it!

## features:
- MV for object recognition and search
- 2x USB-C ports for charging and data transfer
- RGBW LED matrix
- 2x 9 axis IMUs 
- 7x rotary encoders to track all 7DOF of the human arm
- a rotary encoder with button to interact with the GUI
- a microSDXC card slot for additional storage
- a set of GPIOs for interacting with other devices
